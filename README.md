## Introduction

Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.

## Description

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss overweight and underweight problems more objectively with their patients. It is a simple mean of classifying sedentary (physically inactive) individuals [1].
